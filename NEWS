Release history of testicle.
_________________________________________

- Example unit tests included. 'make check' will build and run the
  tests in example.cc.

testicle 1.7 (2013-08-12):

- Test cases can now be labeled as such by marking it with a
  testicle::TC argument.  I.e. one can be named 'area::something(TC)'
  instead of 'area::test_something()'.  I find this more readable.

- The generated test program now accepts mixed flag arguments
  and non-flags, e.g. './test foo -v'.

- Somewhat improved and clarified documentation.

testicle 1.6 (2011-10-16):

- Some internal cleanup. Finally removed testicle::AssertionError.

testicle 1.5 (2010-07-16):

- Two more assertions (le and ge), and some documentation
  improvements.

testicle 1.4 (2008-11-23):

- When a test has the outcome ERROR (uncaught and unexpected
  exception), include it in the listing at the end, after the normal
  failures.  Before, you either had to guess which test it was, or use
  the -v option.

testicle 1.3 (2007-11-12):

- testicle::Failure: an additional templated constructor, in order to
  make it easier to create useful error messages. Also slightly
  improved error messages in general: "Failure: 1 > 2" rather than
  "1 > 2".

testicle 1.2 (2007-07-08):

- AssertionError was a stupid name for the exception involved in
  causing a test to FAIL. It's now called "Failure" instead, but the
  old name is retained as a typedef for a while.

testicle 1.1 (2007-07-07):

- Fixed warnings related to constness of string literals, when using
  g++ 4.2 and lots of warnings enabled.

testicle 1.0 (2007-07-02):

- First release, for my personal use.
